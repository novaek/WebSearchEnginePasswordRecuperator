Hello everyone, here is my project for deciphering passwords from search engines.

here is both c# an python scripts.

the both retrieves password to a discord webhook.
the python one handle base85 encoded webhooks for obfuscation.

the C-Sharp one can only handle normal URL for Discord Webhooks.

you have to put your own webhook before using it.

Have fun !

everything if for learning purposes. I won't be held reliable for any malevolent actions made with my code.
